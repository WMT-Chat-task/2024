# Metrics Task Overview

This shared task will examine automatic evaluation metrics for machine translation. We will provide you with MT system outputs along with source text and the human reference translations. We are looking for automatic metric scores for translations at the system-level, and segment-level. We will calculate the system-level, and segment-level correlations of your scores with human judgements.

We invite submissions of reference-free metrics in addition to reference-based metrics.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [Contact Us](mailto:wmt.metrics@gmail.com)!
